# Marketing-Page

## SetUp/Usage
 HTML/Vanilla CSS

 ## Requirements
 Any IDE should work

 ## Project Notes
 My first build week project.
 Sign Up/Log In links to the group project.
 External links to photos - I know could/should download them into my assets and link internally.
 I switched images too frequently.

 ## Design Notes
 I'm certain there are more elegant solutions to flip-cards and positioning.
 I used grid instead of flex to better align my grid of cards. 
 I don't want uneven rows.
 Wireframe in the assets.

 ## Dev Notes
 CSS files 
 No LESS/NO SASS
